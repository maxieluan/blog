## Introduction
1. Introduce the concept.
2. Mention the recent hype of LK-99.
## Superconductivity basics
1. What is superconductivity?
2. My past understanding of superconductivity, which is wrong. 

## diamagnetism
1. What is diamagnetism?
2. How does it work?
3. How does it relate to superconductivity?

## Levitation
1. Difference between superconducting levitation and magnetic levitation.
2. Theoretically, you don't need external energy to maintain the levitation.

## Problem with the hype
Come back to the LK-99
1. The photo proof is not convincing. 
2. Strong dismagnetism does not guarantee superconductivity.
3. It's not production ready. 

## Conclusion
The areas that would actually benefit from superconductivity are:
1. Power transmission
2. Magnetic levitation
3. MRI
4. Particle accelerator
