## Introduction
Recently, a team from South Korea published a paper on arxiv about a room temperature superconducting material called LK-99. They claim this material can be produced using pretty ordinary lab methods, no special equipment is needed. The paper is not peer reviewed. 

This paper caused a lot of hype in the media. It's understandable, in the context of 2023. This is a year which people would refer to as tech singlarity. In this year, there is significant breakthroughs in AI, bring us one step seemingly closing to AGI. At this point, any other breakthroughs in science would seem perfectly believed. 

I am not from material science background. So, I didn't jump on the hype train. I observed the hype, and I am curious about the science behind it. This is not supposed to be a scientific article. It's just something I never knew before. I would like also provide some of my opinions about the hype. 

## Superconductivity basics
As the name suggests, superconductivity is a phenomenon that a material can conduct electricity without resistance. This is a very useful property. It can be used in power transmission, MRI, particle accelerator, etc. 

But that basically sums up all my understanding of superconductivity. The article from South Korea comes with a photo, in which a very small piece of LK-99 is levitating above a magnet. This is the reason people are excited. I cannot understand it. 

I am not saying I don't understand magnetic levitation. In China, magnetic levitation trains have been operational for many years. I was on one of them once. I understand the basic principle of magnetic levitation. But I don't understand how it relates to superconductivity. I certainly don't understand how a levitation photo can prove superconductivity.

From some of the concepts I learn at school, superconductors doesn't have resistance. So, if you apply some current to it, it will keep flowing forever. I think that means, with very little energy, you can create perminant magnetic field. That's why it can levitate. But, doesn't that require the material to be shaped in a looped form? How can a small piece of material levitate if it's not a closed circuit?

## diamagnetism
This brings the concept of diamagnetism. Diamagnetism is a property of all materials, which is the ability to repel magnetic field. This is different from paramagnetism and ferromagnetism. Paramagnetism is the ability to attract magnetic field. Ferromagnetism is the ability to attract magnetic field and keep it. The latter two are what we usually refer to as magnet. Bue diamagnetism is a property of all materials.

### How does diamagnetism work?
I suspected that diamagnetism is a result of induced current. As we have learned by Faraday's law, a changing magnetic field will induce a current. So, if a material is approaching a magnet, the magnetic field is changing. So, it will induce a current in the material. The current will create a magnetic field that is opposite to the magnet. So, it will repel the magnet. 

This is partially true. The difference is that, Faraday's law requires the material to be a closed circuit. Materials have a certain micro formation of what they call cooper pairs. It's essentially a pair of electrons formed by the attractive interaction mediated by lattice vibrations (phonons) in the crystal structure. When magnetic fields are applied, the cooper pairs will move in a circular motion, acting like very tiny closed circuits, creating induced current, and repelling the magnetic field. All the cooper pairs add up, and create a macro effect of repelling the magnetic field. This phenomenon is called diamagnetism.

### How does it relate to superconductivity?
While diamagnetism is a property of all materials, they are not strong. When materials have resistance, the induced current will die down, in the form of heat. The repelling effect will be very weak. But, when the material has no resistance, the current will keep flowing. As the the material keeps approaching the magnet, the current will increase, and the repelling effect will increase. When the repelling force equals the gravity, the material will levitate. Theoretically, you don't need external energy to maintain the levitation.

But I can't seem to find a closed form math formula to calculate the repelling force in respect to the position, the gravity, and the magnetic field. I think there are many reasons for that. For example, this is a complex process, that might involve too many factors. Some of them, cannot be easily quantified, like material properties. Not to mention, many of the interaction between the factors are not linear. Rather than digging for a formula, it's more reasonable to use numerical methods to simulate the process.

Anyway, what I am saying is that, superconductivity might not guarantee levitation. But it's possible to levitate with superconductivity.

On the other hand, does levitation serve as solid proof of superconductivity? I don't think so either. If something levitates on its own, it could be one of many reasons. It could be superconductivity, hopefully. It could also be because the material is magnetic. In most cases, it's because the material is very strong diamagnetic.

The thing about strong diamagnetism is that, it looks a lot like Meissner effect, but it's not. While in Meissner effect, the levitation can be maintained by the supercurrent, in strong diamagnetism, the induced current will dissipate as heat. It might not be noticeable in a short period of time. But it will eventually fall down.

## Problem with the hype
Come back to the LK-99

One of the reason people are skeptical about the paper is that, the photo is all the evidence they have. In the photo, one tip of the material is touching the magnet. This doesn't look a lot like levitation. 

As I have previously mentioned, strong diamagnetism is hard to distinguish from Meissner effect, especially in a short period of time or in a static photo. Though room temp diamagnetism is very impressive, the photo itself cannot prove it's superconducting. 

Some argue that, well, even if it's not superconducting, it's still a very impressive material. They claim it might show us a different way to achieve room temperature superconductivity. But there's a logic problem here. Achieving superconducting is not a linear path. It's not like it's a moutain to climb, where the top is superconducting, and at 80% of the height it's diamagnetism and if you just stick to it, you will reach the top eventually. The process is more like a maze. Some of the ends looks promising, but that might be as far as it can get you. What if this strong diamagnetism is the end of this path? That's totally possible. 

## Conclusion
The areas that would actually benefit from superconductivity are:
1. Power transmission
2. Magnetic levitation
3. MRI
4. Particle accelerator
